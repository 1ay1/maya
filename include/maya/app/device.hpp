// Render-coherence type-state (parameterized double-buffer)
// ============================================================================
// The terminal/canvas relationship has two genuine states, encoded as the
// alternatives of a std::variant.  This is the parameterized-canvas form:
// the *only* path that carries the canonical front buffer is the Synced
// alternative — Divergent literally has no Canvas member.  An incremental
// diff therefore cannot be issued from a Divergent state because the front
// buffer required by the diff routine is physically inaccessible.
//
//   FullscreenSynced { Canvas front; }
//       Terminal pixels are known to match `front`.  The next render can
//       diff (canvas_ vs front) and emit only the changed cells.  Producer:
//       a successful end-to-end frame write.
//
//   InlineSynced { InlineFrameState state; }
//       Inline analogue: `state.prev_cells/prev_rows` accurately model
//       the current scrollback tail.  compose_inline_frame() can do its
//       row-diff against this state.
//
//   Divergent {}
//       Terminal pixels are unknown — write failed mid-frame, resize
//       happened, or this is the first render.  The only legal next move
//       is a full serialize / clear-and-paint, which (on success) returns
//       to Synced.
//
// std::visit on either variant gives compile-time exhaustiveness: adding
// a new state forces every dispatcher to handle it or fail to build.
//
// INLINE COHERENCE NOTE
// ————————————————————————————————————————————
// The inline path no longer uses `coherent::InlineState`. It now uses
// `maya::inline_frame::InlineCoherence` (the Witness Chain), which has
// six type-tagged states (Empty / Fresh / Synced / Stale / HardReset /
// Sealed) instead of the previous two (InlineSynced / Divergent). The
// chain enforces every render precondition at compile time — see
// docs/internals/witness-chain.md. The legacy InlineSynced/Divergent
// types remain for FULLSCREEN coherence; inline mode uses InlineCoherence.
