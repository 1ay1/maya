// maya/core/executor.hpp — how maya's view code asks for parallel work
// without owning a thread.
//
// The view library (libmaya) doesn't link a runtime: a renderer must work
// with no loop at all. But two widgets want parallelism — Pixels::fill_rows
// (a parallel-for over rows) and StreamingMarkdown's big-document parse.
// They used to start std::threads. Now they ask this hook, and maya::app
// installs a jaal-backed executor at startup (<maya/runtime.hpp>), so every
// thread in a maya program is jaal's.
//
// With nothing installed (a bare renderer, a unit test), work runs inline on
// the caller. That's slower, never wrong: both callers are correct serially.
