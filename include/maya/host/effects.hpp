// maya/host/effects.hpp — things only the TERMINAL can do.
//
// These are this host's effects rather than jaal core ones, so a program
// lists the ones it uses in its Cmd:
//
//     using Cmd = jaal::Cmd<Msg, commit_scrollback>;
//     return commit_from(m.frozen.harvest());
//
// and a host that can't do them (a test host, a GUI) won't compile against
// it. terminal_host (host.hpp) is what carries them out; each one is a
// single Screen call.
