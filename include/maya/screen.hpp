// maya/screen.hpp — the terminal as a device: maya without a runtime.
//
// A Screen owns the tty (through the type-state maya::Terminal<State>):
// raw mode, alt screen or inline, the input parser,
// the frame encoder and what it knows is on screen and in scrollback) and
// NOTHING that waits. Every method is one non-blocking step; there is no
// loop, no timer, no thread, no quit flag. A runtime (jaal, via maya-jaal,
// or a hand-written loop in a test) drives it:
//
//     auto term = maya::Screen::open({.mode = Mode::Inline});
//     watch(term->input_handle());                 // the runtime's reactor
//     ...on readable:   for (auto& ev : *term->read()) route(ev);
//     ...on a change:   Presented f = term->present(view(model));
//                       schedule(f.redraw_at);     // an animation wants more
//                       if (f.backpressured) watch_writable();
//     ...on writable:   term->flush();
//
// Why `Presented` is a return value: drawing has outputs a scheduler must act
// on (a widget asked to be drawn again; a scroll view learned its size and
// the frame used stale zeros; the tty refused bytes). They used to be
// thread-local globals every loop had to remember to read, and one of
// maya's three loops forgot two of them. A struct returned by the call that
// produces it can't be forgotten: using the frame means holding it.
//
// See docs/internals/design.md for the design.

    // the user will never see: measured, doom_fire exits 1 ms after `q` but
    // the screen keeps playing old fire for as long as the backlog lasts.
