// maya::theme — semantic color slots, and the terminal they land on.
//
// ── The default is NATIVE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// theme::native states almost no colors of its own. Its slots resolve to
// Color::default_color() — SGR 39/49, "whatever this terminal uses" — and
// to the sixteen NAMED ansi slots, which are indices into the palette the
// user configured, not colors maya picked.
//
// That is the only theme that is correct everywhere, and the reason is
// polarity. A palette of literal RGB is authored against one background:
// pick #565F89 for muted text and it reads on black and vanishes on light
// grey. maya cannot know the background — no terminal reliably reports it
// — so the only safe move is not to state one. Emit `39` and the user's
// foreground arrives, whatever they chose; emit `31` and their red
// arrives, already contrast-checked against their own background by them.
//
// The cost is that native cannot express a shade the palette lacks. Where
// a theme would use a dim blue-grey, native uses BOLD and DIM attributes
// for hierarchy instead of a third colour — which is what a 16-colour
// terminal has always done, and what degrades cleanly to monochrome.
//
// ── The named schemes are opt-in ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// style/schemes.hpp carries Dracula, Nord, Gruvbox, Solarized, Catppuccin,
// TokyoNight and the rest, generated from mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes.
// Those DO state literal colors, including a background, which is the
// point of choosing one: the user has said "paint it like this" and maya
// then owns the whole surface. They are never a default.

// ============================================================================
// Theme - named color slots for semantic UI coloring
// ============================================================================
// 23 named slots covering general UI chrome, status colors, and diff
// highlighting.
//
// Every field is a LitColor, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic.
// A slot resolving to another slot made resolve() a PARTIAL function that
// advertised itself as total: `t.primary = Color::slot(Accent)` used to make
// resolve() hand back Kind::Slot, and the slot's enum then travelled onward
// as a red channel. LitColor cannot hold a slot, so the cycle is
// unrepresentable and resolve() is total because its codomain says so.
//
// ── One list ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MAYA_THEME_SLOTS below is the single authored statement of what a slot
// IS. The ThemeSlot enum, the struct's fields, resolve()'s switch, the
// field-name table and the completeness check are all generated from it.
//
// A slot used to be four separate edits — enum, field, switch arm, and every
// scheme — and missing any one of them failed differently: a missing switch
// arm is a -Wswitch warning (only fatal under MAYA_WERROR, which is CI-only),
// while a missing FIELD in the 57 designated-initializer schemes was silent
// and became ColorKind::Unset. Now the first three cannot disagree because
// they are one statement, and the fourth is caught by complete() below.
//
// The struct stays a plain aggregate: `Theme{.primary = ..., ...}` is exactly
// as before, which is what keeps all 57 schemes and every derive() call site
// untouched.
