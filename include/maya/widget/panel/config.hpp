    // A panel that shows SEVERAL views of one subject renders a tab strip

    // existing panel: this is additive, and a host that never sets `tabs`
    // builds exactly the frame it built before.
    //
    // It lives in the widget rather than in the one host that needed it
    // first, because a tab strip is CHROME. Every chrome decision in this
    // family — border, viewport clipping, scrollbar glyphs, keeping the
    // selection in view — belongs to the widget, and hosts supply data. A
    // strip hand-rolled into `header` by each host would drift in padding,
    // in the selected-tab treatment, and in how it degrades when the panel
    // is narrower than its labels; three hosts would mean three strips that
    // look almost alike.
    //
    // `tab_active` indexes `tabs`. Out of range renders every tab inactive

    // a slightly wrong strip, not take down the frame.

    // is orthogonal to the mark: it answers "how loud" where the mark

    //
    // Panel wraps its body in `.padding(1, 2).border(Round)`: one border
    // column and two pad columns on each side. Content laid out at the
    // panel's OUTER width is therefore six columns too wide, and a Canvas
    // clips rather than spills — so the excess does not paint past the
    // frame, it paints OVER the frame's own right border and stops. The
    // visible damage is a row that simply has no right edge.
    //
    // This was a number every caller had to know and none was told. The
    // one caller that noticed hand-counted it (agentty's stats panel:
    // `sheet.reserve_right(7)`, derived by measuring at three widths), and
    // a hand-counted constant describing someone else's internals goes
    // stale the moment the padding changes — silently, because nothing
    // references anything. A probe across all 14 agentty panels found 13
    // losing their border below 60 columns.

    // crosses the viewport, and a body whose width changes at that moment
    // is a layout that shifts under the reader for a reason they cannot
    // see. It is also the only way to break the circularity — whether the

    // A DOCUMENT wants the opposite. On a 200-column terminal a single
    // column of rows is a narrow ribbon with two thirds of the screen blank
    // and the reader scrolling for content that would have fitted.

    // The panel supplies only the two facts it alone owns — the body width
    // (it owns the border, the padding and the scrollbar gutter) and where
    // the section boundaries are. Everything geometric is maya::columns():
    // how many columns the ceiling implies, dividing the slot exactly so no
    // strip is left over, and balancing by measured height. That split is

    // whose contents differ in length make a shrink-wrapping frame resize
    // every time the reader switches view — the stats viewer measured 13
    // rows on one tab and 30 on another, the whole box jumping under the
