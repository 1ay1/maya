// maya::panel::ItemCtx — what an item widget may know while rendering.
//
// Deliberately tiny. An item renders from its own value plus this context,
// and NOTHING else — no Config, no row list, no layout. That is what keeps
// "one item kind = one widget file" honest: a widget that could reach the
// whole panel would grow panel logic.

    // Text/Path: columns the edited value may occupy before it scrolls
    // horizontally under its caret (Panel::edit_budget()). 0 = unmeasured.
    int edit_budget = 0;

    // Columns a DRAWN control may occupy — the width budget for kinds whose
    // glyphs are a picture rather than a word: a bar, a meter, a strip.
    //
    // Every such kind currently hardcodes its own size (Slider's kCells =
    // 12) because a control had no way to learn how much room it was in.
    // The result is a picture that stays the same size on a 40-column split
    // pane and a 200-column terminal — responsive in neither direction,
    // which is the same defect agentty's stat sheet works around with a
    // hand-counted reserve constant.
    //
    // Derived from min_width like edit_budget, and for the same reason,
    // which the sibling's comment states precisely: a scroll viewport
    // measures its children against an unbounded width to discover the
    // content extent, so a control that asked the LAYOUT how wide it is
    // would answer "2^24" during measure, publish that as the panel's
    // horizontal extent, and dirty the scroll state on every resize. The
    // budget is a fact known BEFORE layout, so it cannot participate in
    // that loop.
    //
    // A hint, never a grant. The layout still clips whatever exceeds the
    // cell; the budget only tells a drawn control what size picture is
    // worth drawing. 0 = unmeasured, and every kind must keep working at 0
    // — which is what the per-kind floor below is for.

    // (npos = no live caret). Written by the editable kinds; the panel

    // needs. A picture needs more: a bar's filled head and its unfilled
    // track are two hues, and they are the whole point — a bar drawn in a
    // single colour is a rectangle, not a scale.
    //
    // Offsets are BYTES into the returned string, matching the caret_out
    // convention above (and StyledRun itself). Left empty, the panel paints
    // the cell in the single returned Style exactly as before, so every
    // existing kind is unaffected.
    //
