// reveal_settled_rows_test — the streaming reveal must never REWRITE a row
// that has already settled above the live tail.
//
// THE BUG THIS PINS. The reveal's line_bounded flag exists so only the bottom
// visual row is ever rewritten: an upper row can scroll into the terminal's
// native scrollback at any frame, and scrollback is immutable — restyling a
// row after it lands there is permanent corruption. But line_bounded was
// implemented as `orig.rfind('\n')`, i.e. the last SOURCE newline. A
// streaming prose paragraph is ONE source line with no newline in it at all;
// the renderer wraps it across many visual rows. So the bound found nothing,
// the effect window opened at the paragraph's first byte, and every frame
// re-styled every wrapped row of the paragraph.
//
// User-visible symptom (what prompted this): mid-glide the tail appears to
// "go back and re-render" — settled words above the cursor visibly change
// styling again. The scrollback hazard was the same defect's silent half.
//
// WHAT THIS MEASURES. Per frame, cells whose CHARACTER is unchanged but whose
// resolved STYLE flipped, bucketed by row. A restyle on the row that is only
// NOW ceasing to be the tail is legitimate (it takes its final styling as the
// cursor leaves). A restyle on a row that was ALREADY above the tail on the
// previous frame is the bug.
//
// Counting styles rather than glyphs is essential: the glyphs don't move, so
// a cell-count or height probe sees nothing at all. reveal_smoothness_probe
// tracks height monotonicity and per-frame cell deltas and stayed green
// through the entire life of this bug.
