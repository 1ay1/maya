// test_render_sweep — the properties every panel row must have at every
// width, asserted on painted pixels rather than on the tree.
//
// This file exists because a specific class of bug kept shipping through a
// green suite. Each case below is a real defect that was found by dumping
// a canvas and counting columns by hand, and that no existing test saw:
//
//   * a meter's VALUE pushed off the end of its row by a bar that grew
//     into the space — at every width, silently
//   * rows painting under the scrollbar in two-column mode
//   * a layout that used LESS of a 90-column terminal than of a 76-column
//     one, because a responsive decision was measured at one width and
//     painted at another
//
// The assertions are deliberately about OUTCOMES a reader would notice,
// not about internal numbers: a number must not disappear, a row must not
// overrun its slot, a wider screen must not render less. Widget internals
// are free to change; these are not.

//   * spacer_rows() set `basis`, which is the MAIN-AXIS size — height in
//     a column, WIDTH in a row. As build()'s scrollbar gutter it made a
//     one-column spacer claim `vh` columns, and being shrink(0) it took
//     the difference out of the body: two columns per viewport row, off
//     the end of every line.
