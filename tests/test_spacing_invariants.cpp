// test_spacing_invariants — the proof that killed the screenshot loop.
//
// ── Why this file exists ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A run of spacing bugs shipped, each found by a human squinting at a
// screenshot, each fixed in isolation:
//
//   • "Anthropic Opus" rendered with the two words TOUCHING, because a
//     separator was removed on the reasoning that the chip's own trailing
//     space would serve — but that space is background-FILLED, so it reads
//     as the chip's padding, not as separation.
//   • the status bar painted "·   ·" with a dead gap between them, because
//     a separator was baked onto the END of one segment on the assumption
//     that another always followed it. When the model badge moved out, the
//     assumption broke and the orphan stayed.
//   • the composer read "    1 words" — four leading spaces from tabular
//     padding that bought nothing in a right-aligned cluster.
//   • the sparkline read "⚡  0.0" — TWO owners each contributed spacing
//     (the "⚡ " literal and a %5.1f right-pad), neither aware of the other,
//     and ⚡ is a 2-column wide glyph on top of that.
//
// One root cause: SPACING WAS ENCODED AS CONTENT. `text(" ")` is not a gap,
// it is a string that happens to be blank — invisible to the layout engine,
// invisible to measurement, and invisible to the shed ladder, so a separator
// inside segment N cannot know segment N+1 was dropped.
//
// Fixing instances one at a time is a treadmill: each fix is invisible until
// someone hits the exact terminal width that reveals it. This file is the
// mechanical version of that squinting. It renders the real widgets across
// every width they must survive and asserts the properties a human was
// checking by eye:
//
//   1. no run of 2+ spaces between visible content (double-gap)
//   2. no separator glyph adjacent to another separator (orphaned sep)
//   3. no separator left dangling at either end of a row
//   4. content never touches where a gap was intended (regression guard)
//
// A widget that hand-rolls spacing will eventually violate one of these at
// SOME width. That is the point: the test sweeps widths so it does not
// depend on anyone guessing which one.

// w + kProbeDelta:
//
//   • a spacer ABSORBS the extra width — its run grows by kProbeDelta;

// ── The width-derivation proof ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Tier 2 of the fix: a spacing literal's WIDTH must be computed from the
// literal, never restated as an integer beside it. status_bar.hpp carried
// `kSepW = 7` next to `"   ·   "`; narrowing the separator left the constant
// reserving four columns nobody painted, and the title chip over-shed on
// exactly the narrow terminals the shed ladder exists for.
//
// These are compile-time facts, asserted at runtime so the intent is
// discoverable from the test suite rather than only from a static_assert.
