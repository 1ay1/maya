// ── The Themed gate, checked by COMPILING ────────────────────────────────
//
// Every other rule in this file is a source scan. This one is different
// because the property is "does this fail to compile", and no scan and no
// static_assert can answer it:
//
//   - a `requires`-expression asks whether an expression is WELL-FORMED,
//     and Themed's literal gate is a consteval THROW. A throw is perfectly
//     well-formed right up until it is evaluated, so requires{} answers
//     true for exactly the case the gate rejects.
//   - the scanners above find literals by SPELLING. They cannot see whether
//     the type system would have caught one.
//
// So the instrument is a compiler. Each probe is a tiny TU that must
// compile, or must not, and the test asserts which.
//
// These are the executable half of the "WHERE Themed BELONGS" comment in
// style/color.hpp: that comment states the scope, the static_asserts there
// pin the type's shape, and these prove the behaviour at the boundary.
